# Statistical assignment 1: Data Analysis 3

This is the statistical assignment 1 for the Data Analysis in Social Science 3 class at the University of Exeter.

The deadline for this assignment is 5 February 2019, 2pm.

You should do the following.

1. Accept an invitation to clone this repository that I'll send you by email. This will create your own private copy of the repository (with the URL https://github.com/dataanalysis3/assignment1/[your Github account]). The teaching assistant, moderator for the module and I will also have access to this repository.

2. Once you've cloned the repository you should start a new project with R Studio and copy it to your computer.

3. Complete the tasks in the assignment1.Rmd file in R Studio. Produce the file assignment1.md with your output using the "github_document" format.

4. Commit and push both .Rmd and .md files to your repository for assignment 1 (not your personal module repository). You can make several commits for different tasks, but the last commit should be made before 2pm on 5 February.

5. Do not forget to include your student number in your .Rmd and .md files.

6. Submit a Word document containing the URL of your repository on Bart. You should do this before 2pm on 5 February.
